# Job Title Normalization Pipeline

## Overview
This project involves a **robust job title normalization pipeline** developed using **Python**, **pandas**, and **multiprocessing**. The pipeline aims to standardize job titles efficiently, leveraging parallel processing for enhanced performance.

## Features
- **Python & pandas**: Core tools for data manipulation and processing.
- **API Integration**: Utilized API calls for external data standardization.
- **Multiprocessing**: Enhanced performance by processing data in parallel chunks, reducing overall runtime.

## Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Import job title data using pandas.
2. **Normalization**:
   - Implement API calls for fetching standardized job titles.
   - Apply pandas transformations for data consistency.
3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Use Python's multiprocessing to process data in parallel, optimizing performance for large datasets.
4. **Output**: Export the normalized job titles for further analysis or integration.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core scripting language.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation library.
- **Multiprocessing**: For parallel data processing.
- **APIs**: For job title standardization.
